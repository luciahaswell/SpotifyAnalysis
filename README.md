# SpotifyAnalysis

After requesting my personal data from Spotify, I wanted a more in-depth analysis of my music listening history. 

In the following notebook are visualizations that display:
* Top 10 artists and their play counts
* Top 10 songs and their play counts
* Top 10 artists and hours listened to 
* Top 10 songs and their play counts from each top 10 artist
* Hours listened to grouped by month 
* Frequency of time of day listened to
